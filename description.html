<h2> Data sets used </h2>
Sequence of numbers scaled to fit 256 x 256 window size. The sequence is garbled using random number generated by uniform distribution.
<br>
<h2> Algorithms simulated </h2>
The following algorithms are simulated at the same speed. 10 ms wait after each comparison operation.
<ol>
<li> Bubble Sort - This algorithm has the worst performance on both data sets</li>
<li> Selection Sort - This has the second worst performance. </li>
<li> Insertion Sort - This performed well on half sorted inputs. Overall this is better than both bubble and selection sorts </li>
<li> Quick Sort - This is the fastest of all. The average case was faster than all others (nlogn). The worst case is slower than merge sort </li>
<li> Merge Sort - This is second best algorithm next to Quick sort. Average case is nlogn.
</ol>
